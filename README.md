# WIP
main.py - Calling functions from other files
# algorithm.py - all the algorithm functions
# testing.py - all test cases created there
# 
# Open question:
# Is it necessary to create a testing.py when can straight up do it in main or just to keep it short and clean in the main
# Should we split testing into 2 files, real and generated data files?
# Should we split data into two folder, real and generated data files?
